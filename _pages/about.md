Hi! I'm a computer nerd that loves to program, sip coffee, and enjoy rainy days!

I'm currently a PhD Student at Vanderbilt University studing Computer Science, with an emphasis on EdTech, AI, and Reinforcement Learning.

My research goal is to determine how we can bring AI to the classroom given the constraints in terms of space, computational, privacy, and monetary resources. Along a similar line, how can we obtain big multimodal data within learning environments to create AI agents that truly understand students and teachers.

You can find me at GitHub!
